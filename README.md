# Library Management System (Static SPA + Backend Skeleton)

- Frontend: `frontend/` with `index.html`, views in `frontend/views/`, shared CSS/JS in `frontend/assets/`
- Backend skeleton: `backend/` with `routes/`, `services/`, `dao/`
- Docs: `docs/ERD.md` including Mermaid ERD

Open `frontend/index.html` in a browser. Navigation is SPA (hash router) and loads view fragments without page refresh.
